## CS 107E - Final Project: EMG Brain Machine Interface 

## William Pan

## Project description
I hope to *(1)* create a way for the Raspberry Pi to read neural signals from the forearm through electromyography and *(2)* interface the device with some kind of visual output (LEDs, screen, etc). The final end goal is to create a wristband that reads electrical signals from the muscle when someone closes their hand and opens their hand. As well, I hope to use an accelerometer to detect the rotation of the arm as another way to interact with the device. The output of the device will be a way to interact with a screen i.e. drawing or turning on certain lights. At the end, I hope to learn more about building and designing a device that can be interfaced with humans as well as the electrical engineering aspects of building the device.
